		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>The Dow added more than 100 points, or 0.4%, to a fresh record high, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also reached record intraday levels. Bitcoin prices spiked more than 12% to a record high of more than $43,000 after Tesla disclosed it purchased $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and may start allowing customers to use Bitcoin to purchase products. Tesla said it also expects to begin accepting bitcoin as payment for its products "in the near future," with some limitations. Planning to accept bitcoin as payment puts Tesla in league with PayPal, which began allowing its customers to buy and sell bitcoin, ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and bitcoin cash (BCH) in its PayPal wallet in December, and will add the function to Venmo this year, along with the ability to make purchases with crypto. What does this mean for Dogecoin which Elon is lowkey behind? Superbowl is over and some sports gambling stocks are going to fall. Do Put options for draft kings and penn national gaming. When Penn hits a low buy in to ride the wave back up. </p>

		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>Shares of GME are about 28% lower than yesterday. AMC slipped another 14% and other companies fueled by the reddit craze are now over. US stock indexes were up. Trading volumes have been down. The NYSE wednesday had its lowest volume day since Jan 21. Nasdaq volume was down by a third from its peak on Jan. 27.</p>

		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>Barstool Sports a growing sports gambling company has been on the rise for the past decade. They were bought last year by PENN National Gaming. Sports gambling is only legal in select states like Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Barstool sports just legalized sports gambling in Michigan on their gambling app. Penn stock has been on the steady fast rise. It is something to watch out for as sports gambling gets legalized in more states.</p>

		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>Global X Cannabis ETF POTX topped the list of the best performing ETF's in January. Their return was about 46.5%. zhas legalization hopes increase in more united States and as Biden's friendly enivornmant for the cannabis market grows we can except as increase to that US industry. Next, the crazed companies that were part of the short squueze are beginning to fall.</p>

		<p>Biggest news would probably be the hit RobinHood is taking right now. I mean lawsuits after lawsuits. They really messed up by restricting certain stocks part of the short squeeze. My best advice would be to take your money out of RobinHood and put it into another platform.</p>

		<h2>February 2/2/2021</h2>

		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>Jim Cramer host of "Mad Money", said this morning,"I think the most important thing is for people to recognize that the quarters last week were really good last week." His whole point of saying that was that he doesn't think that Gamestop and Amc are not big enough to topple the market. He thinks they both are regulatory risks and not systemic risks. To contrast this Gamestop and Amc are not the only companies that have been over valued. When companies begin to become over-valued there usually is a correction in the market to regulate their value. Vaccines are rolling out, and the Covid numbers are gradually getting a little better. It's time to at least think about buying online travel agency stocks.</p>

		<h4>Market Re-Cap</h4>

		<p>Friday and Thurday were overall pretty red days. Robinhood will continue to limit trading on Monday in short-squeeze names like GameStop. The millennial-favored stock trading app has cut down its list of restricted stocks from as many as 50 on Friday to eight on Monday. General Motors as part of its plan to be a carbon-neutral company with an “all-electric future” in 20 years, announced this week it will supply fuel cells to Navistar, a leading maker of big trucks. What does this mean for FuelCell?</p>

		<h3>January 1/30/2021</h3>
		<small>by Dr. Stock</small>

		<p>Robinhood itself is a complete sellout. The people that are fighting for people to have money have left them in the dirt. We the people are furious."How can you tell us that we can't make any more money eventhough you wanted us to start investing in the market." <br><br> "Someone is going to jail"- Dave Portnoy(Founder of Barstool Sports and a notable day trader.) says on BBC. The higher ups should be getting in trouble but the fact is they won't. They probably have the ability right now to call their broker and buy shares in the companies Robinhood halted.<br><br>There is going to be a big correction in the market soon which means a large decline because too many companies have been over priced.</p>

		<header class="TPs">1/30/2021 Pick(s)</header>
		<ol>
			<li>SQQQ and FAZ</li>
			<ul>
				Their stock values will go up if the market goes down. I think it is a great investment because right now the market is a gamble which is already leading towards a rapid decline. <br><br>SQQQ and FAZ are inverse ETF's. An inverse ETF is an exchange traded fund (ETF) constructed by using various derivatives to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark. Inverse ETFs allow investors to make money when the market or the underlying index declines, but without having to sell anything short.

		<h3>January 1/27/2021</h3>
		<small>by Dr. Stock</small>

		<p>We are no longer buying and trading stocks. This is gambling. There is no gurantee that companies from the 1990s are going to keep seeing an increase in their stock. Everytime you think the stock won't go up anymore or you think that you are too late to buy stocks of those companies you are wrong. Their stock value continues to keep increasing. WallStreet is probably going to suspend some stocks on WallStreet bets.</p>

		<header class="TPs">1/27/2021 Pick(s)</header>
		<ol>
			<li>BlackBerry Ltd</li>
			<ul>
				Blackberry is one of the last companies from that time era that is seeing an increase in stock value. Since we can not use charts or chart anlysis to evalute increase we must go off common sense. In the last 5 days there has been a 98% increase in stock value and since the beginning of the new year we have seen a 278% increase in stock value.
